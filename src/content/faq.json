      "question": "What is Red Propulsion?",
      "answer": "Red Propulsion is the official student rocketry team of the University of Florence (Università degli Studi di Firenze). We are a group of passionate students who design, build, and launch high-power rockets to compete in international competitions, pushing the boundaries of student-led aerospace engineering."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to be an engineering student to join?",
      "answer": "Not at all! While many of our members study engineering, we welcome students from all degree programs. Building a rocket requires a wide range of skills. We have roles in management, marketing, finance, and communications, in addition to our technical departments like Propulsion, Avionics, and Structures. Passion for space and technology is the only real prerequisite."
    },
    {
      "question": "I have no experience with rockets. Can I still apply?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We believe in learning by doing. We are looking for motivated individuals who are eager to learn and contribute. We provide internal training and mentorship to get new members up to speed. Your enthusiasm is more important than your experience."
    },
    {
      "question": "What kind of skills are you looking for?",
      "answer": "We need a diverse set of skills! On the technical side, experience with CAD software (e.g., SolidWorks, Fusion 360), programming (C++, Python), electronics (PCB design), or simulation software (CFD, FEA) is a plus. For non-technical roles, we look for skills in project management, graphic design, social media management, public speaking, and fundraising. If you're a team player and a problem-solver, you'll fit right in."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much of a time commitment is required?",
      "answer": "The time commitment can vary depending on the project cycle and your specific role. On average, members dedicate a few hours per week. This increases during critical phases like manufacturing or before a competition. We are all students, so we understand the importance of balancing team activities with academic responsibilities."
